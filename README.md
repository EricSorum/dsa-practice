# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains a record of my notes and solutions to Leetcode problems.

## Strategy

I approach Leetcode in four ways, alternating each strategy between practice sessions.

1. Clickety-clack

This method is focused on just typing out code.  I read Leetcode Easy problems and type out solutions without doing much research or careful thought into optimization or edge cases.  This ensures I get plenty of practice in recalling common JavaScript syntax and methods, while improving my typing and 

2.  Cheating

I make an earnest attempt at solving a Leetcode Medium problem, and then look up the solution, usually the one posted by CodingNinja.

I carefully study the solution, and then type it out on my own.

3. Booksmart

To become booksmart, I take time to study pure theory, such as the types of Leetcode problems, how to optimize for speed, as well as other programming theory.

4. Testing

Finally, when I feel ready to test myself, I make an attempt at solving a Leetcode problem on my own and logging the solution in my Leetcode account.  I attempt to identify the type of problem it is and the optimal solution.  I rely on the practice I've gained from the first three methods to pass actual tests.
